## Type	Function : BOOL

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Input	PT** | POINTER TO BYTE (address of the  Buffer  ) |
| **SIZE** | UINT (size of the buffer) |
| **INIT** | BYTE (initial value) |
| **Output** | BOOL (Returns TRUE) |
| **The function _BUFFER_INIT initializes any array of Byte with value INIT. When called, a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is passed to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads** | _BUFFER_INIT(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array), INIT), where array is the name of the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifies the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines the size of the array. The function only returns TRUE. The array specified by the pointer is manipulated directly in memory. |
| | This type of processing arrays is very efficient because no additional memory is required and no surrender values must be copied. |

**Example:**

```iecst
_BUFFER_INIT(ADR(bigarray), SIZEOF(bigarray),3) initializes bigarray with 3.
```
