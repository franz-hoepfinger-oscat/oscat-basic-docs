## ESR_MON_X8

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Type** | Function module |
| **Input	S0..7** | Byte  (  status Inputs  ) |
| **DT_IN** | DATE_TIME (time-date-time stamp for input) |
| **Mode** | Byte (designate the type of processing of messages) |
| **Output	ESR_FLAG** | BOOL (TRUE when messages are present) |
| **IN/OUT	 ESR_OUT** | array [0..7]  of  [ESR_DATA](../Data Types/esr_data.md) (collected messages) |
| **Setup	A0..7** | STRING  (10) (signal address of the inputs) |
| | ESR_MON_X8 collects status messages of up to 8 ESR compatible modules, provides them with a  Timestamp  ,  date stamp  ,  input number and a module address. The collected messages are buffered and passed to a protocol module. If messages for transmission are present, this is indicated by the signal ESR_FLAG. At input DT_IN the current time, which is used for the timestamp of the messages should be provided. The MODE input determines which status messages should be passed. |
| | When the MODE input is not wired, automatically all messages are processed. |
| **The ESR data at the output consist of the following items** | .TYP	1 = error, 2 = State, 3 = Debug  . ADRESS	Byte address of ESR data recording .LINE	Line number (input) of the ESR data recording .DS	Date stamp of type DATE_TIME .DT	Timestamp of type TIME (PLC  Timer  ) .Data	Data Byte 0 contains the status message |

| | An application example for the module is in the description of ESR_COLLECT. |
