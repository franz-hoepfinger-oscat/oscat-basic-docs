|:---|:---|
| **Input	IN** | DWORD (input data) |
| **N** | INT (number of bits to be shifted) |
| **Output** | DWORD (Result) |
| | SHR1 pushes the input to N bits to the right and fills the left N bits with 1's. In contrast to the IEC standard function SHL, which filles when pushing  with zeros, at SHR1 is filled with ones. |
