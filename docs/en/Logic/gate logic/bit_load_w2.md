## Type	Function: WORD

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Input	I** | WORD (input value) |
| **D** | BOOL (value of bits to be loaded) |
| **P** | INT (position of the bits to be loaded) |
| **N** | INT (number of bits that are loaded from position P) |
| **Output** | WORD (output) |
| | BIT_LOAD_W2 can set or delete multiple bits in a WORD at the same time. The position is indicated with 0 for Bit 0 and 15 for Bit 15. N specifies how many bits from the specified location can be changed. If N = 0, no bits are changed. If P and N is specified that the bits to be written goes over the highest bit (bit 15), so it starts again at bit 0. |
