## _ARRAY_MUL

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Type	Function** | BOOL |
| **Input	PT** | Pointer  (Pointer to the array) |
| **SIZE** | UINT (size of the array) |
| **X** | REAL (multiplier) |
| **Output** | BOOL (TRUE) |
| **The function _ARRAY_MUL multiply each element of an arbitrary array  of  REAL with the value X. When called a Pointer  to  the array and its size in bytes is passed to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads** | _ARRAY_MUL(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array), X), where array is the name of the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifies the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines the size of the array. The function only returns TRUE. The array specified by the pointer is manipulated directly in memory. |
| | This type of processing arrays is very efficient because no additional memory is required and no surrender values must be copied. |
| **Call** | _ARRAY_MUL(ADR(bigarray), SIZEOF(bigarray), X) |

**Example:**

```iecst
[0,-2,3,-1-5], X = 3 is converted into [0, -6,9,-3,-15]
```
