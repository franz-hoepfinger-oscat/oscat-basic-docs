## ARRAY_SPR

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Type	Function** | REAL |
| **Input	PT** | Pointer  (Pointer to the array) |
| **SIZE** | UINT (size of the array) |
| **Output** | REAL (dispersion of the array) |
| **The function ARRAY_SPR determines the dispersion of an arbitrary array  of REAL. The dispersion is the maximum value in the array minus the minimum value of the array. When called, a Pointer to the array and its size in bytes is transferred to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads** | ARRAY_SPR(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(Array)), where array is the name of the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifies the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines the size of the array. In order to determine the maximum, the array referenced by the pointer is scanned directly in memory. The function ARRAY_SPR does not change the content of the array. |
| | This type of processing arrays is very efficient because no additional memory is required and no surrender values must be copied. |

**Example:**

```iecst
ARRAY_SPR(ADR(bigarray), SIZEOF(bigarray)) = maximumvalue(bigarray) - minimalvalue(bigarray)
```
