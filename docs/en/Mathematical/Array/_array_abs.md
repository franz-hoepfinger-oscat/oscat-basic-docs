## _ARRAY_ABS

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Type	Function** | BOOL |
| **Input	PT** | Pointer  (Pointer to the array) |
| **SIZE** | UINT (size of the array) |
| **Output** | BOOL (TRUE) |
| **The function _ARRAY_ABS calculates the elements of an arbitrary array  Of  REAL in an absolute value. When called, a pointer to the array and its size in bytes is transferred to the function. Under CoDeSys the call reads** | _ARRAY_ABS(ADR(Array), SIZEOF(array)), where array is the name of the array to be manipulated. ADR() is a standard function which identifies the pointer to the array and SIZEOF() is a standard function, which determines the size of the array. The function only returns TRUE. The array specified by the pointer is manipulated directly in memory. |
| | This type of processing arrays is very efficient because no additional memory is required and no surrender values must be copied. |
| **Call** | _ARRAY_ABS(ADR(bigarray), SIZEOF(bigarray)) |
