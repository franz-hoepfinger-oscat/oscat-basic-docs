## Type	Function: DINT

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Input	X** | INT (input) |
| **Output** | DINT (Faculty of X) |
| | The function  FACT calculates the factorial of X. |
| | It is defined for input values from 0 .. 12. For values less than zero and greater than 12 is the result -1. For the factorial of larger numbers, the GAMMA function is suitable. |
| **For natural numbers X** | X! = 1*2*3...*(X-1)*X, 	0! = 1 |
| | Faculties of negative or non-whole numbers are not defined. |

**Example:**

```iecst
1! = 1 2! = 1*2 = 2 5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120
