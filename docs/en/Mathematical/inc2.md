## Type	Function: INT

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Input	X** | INT (input) |
| **D** | INT (value to be added to the input value) |
| **L** | INT (lower limit) |
| **U** | INT (upper limit) |
| **Output** | INT (output value) |
| | INC2 addes valued D to the input X and ensures that the output INC does not exceed the value U (upper limit) or under-run the value L (low limit). If the result from the addition of X and D  is larger than U so it begins again with L. It is ensured that at negative D when reaching L counted again at U on. The feature is especially useful when addressing arrays and buffers. Even the positioning of absolute encoders it can be used. INC2 can be used to decrementieren with a negative D, while INC2 will ensure that the result is not below zero. |
| **INC2** | = X + D, where L <= INC2 <= U. |

**Example:**

```iecst
INC2(2, 2, -1, 3) result -1 INC2(2, -2, -1, 3) result 0 INC2(2, 1, -1, 3) result 3 INC2(0, -2, -1, 3) result 3
```
