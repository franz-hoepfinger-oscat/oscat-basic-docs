## LTIME_TO_UTC

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Type	Function** | DATE_TIME |
| **Input	LTIME** | DATE_TIME (local time) |
| **DST** | BOOL (TRUE if daylight saving time is true) |
| **TIME_ZONE_OFFSET** | INT (time difference to UTC in minutes) |
| **Output** | DATE_TIME (UTC, Universal Time) |
| | LTIME_TO_UTC calculates UTC (Universal Time) from a given local time.  The world time is calculated by subtracting from the TIME_ZONE_OFFSET LTIME local time. If the DST is active (DST = TRUE), an additional hour of LTIME is deducted. |

| **Note** | The summer time is not regulated the same in all countries. The function assumes that in addition to summer time a further hour is added to offset. |
