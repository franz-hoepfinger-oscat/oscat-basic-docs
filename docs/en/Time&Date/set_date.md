## Type	Function: DATE

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Input	YEAR** | INT (year) |
| **MONTH** | INT (month) |
| **DAY** | INT (day) |
| **Output** | DATE (Composite date) |
| | The function SET_DATE calculates a Date (DATE) from the input values, day, month and year.  SET_DATE does not test the validity of a date. For example, also be February, 30th will be set, which, of course results the 1st March or in a leap year, the March, 2nd. SET_DATE can therefore also be used to generate any day of the year. This can be a quite practicable application. In this case, the monthly amount may also be 0. An invalid month always gives a date in relation to January. An invalid month (month < 1 or month > 12) is always interpreted as January. |
