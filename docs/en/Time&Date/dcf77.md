| | The function DCF77 decodes the serial signal of DCF77 receiver and controls 2 internal clock RTC and RTC1, or via output TP external (downstream) watches. An output DS is TRUE if daylight saving time is. The output WDAY is the weekday (1 = Monday). The output ERROR is TRUE if no valid signal is received. The internal clocks continue to run anyway, also if they already synchronized. A   Another output SYNC indicates that  in  internal clocks are synchronized with DCF77 and gets FALSE if they  were synchronized by not less than the setup variable SYNC_TIMEOUT specified time. The internal clocks runs always with the accuracy of the SPS  Timers  further. By double-clicking the icon in the CFC editor other setup variables are defined. Here SYNC_TIMEOUT sets, after which time the output signal SYNC gets FALSE, if the internal clock RTC and RTC1 were not synchronized by DCF77. The variable time_offset determines the time difference between local time (RTC1) from the UTC.  Default  is 1 hour for CET (Central European Time). The variable TIME_OFFSET is of type INTEGER thus also time zones with negative offset (west of Greenwich) are possible. |
| | By DST_EN is determined whether RTC1 should automatically switch to summer time or not. The output MSEC extends the by RTC to RTC1 provided time to milliseconds. The [SDT](../Data Types/sdt.md) is used to put the internal clock RTC and RTC1 to a defined initial value, so that immediately after the start a valid time is available. During the first cycle date and time is copied from [SDT](../Data Types/sdt.md) to RTC and runs from the first cycle. If necessary, the internal CLOCK can be set always new with the asynchronous set input SET. However, it is overwritten again by a valid DCF77 signal after a cycle, unless the SET input remains TRUE. If a valid DCF77 signal was decoded, RTC and RTC1 is synchronized to the corresponding precise DCF77 time. At the input of [SDT](../Data Types/sdt.md) for example, the time from the information contained in the PLC Hardware Clock can be used. It must be ensured, that the DCF77 is called only if a valid time is already present in [SDT](../Data Types/sdt.md), the DCF77 reads this value only once in the first cycle, or at any time when the SET input is set to TRUE. |
