## Type	Function

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Input	IDATE** | DATE (date) |
| **D** | INT (days to be added) |
| **W** | INT (weeks to be added) |
| **M** | INT (months to be added) |
| **Y** | INT (years to be added) |
| **Output** | DATE (result date) |
| | The function DATE_ADD add days, weeks, months, and add years to a date. First the module adds the specified days and weeks, then months and finally the years. |
| | The input values can be both positive as well be negative. So it can also be subtracted from a date. |
| | Note that especially for negative input values the sum of negative values, i.e. -3000 days does not run below 1.1.1970 because this would have an overflow of data type DATE and undefined values are obtained. |

```
