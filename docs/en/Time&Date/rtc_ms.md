| **Type** | Function module |
| **Input	SET** | BOOL (set input) |
| **[SDT](../Data Types/sdt.md)** | DT (set date and time) |

| **XMS** | INT (milliseconds output) |
| | RTC_MS is a clock component with a resolution of milliseconds and date. The time is automatically every time you SET = TRUE to the value of [SDT](../Data Types/sdt.md) and SMS. If SET = FALSE the time is running on their own and provides the output XDT the current date and time, and at the output XMS milliseconds. The output XMS counts  every second 0-999 and begins with the next second again at 0. The accuracy of the clock depends on the millisecond  Timer  of the PLC. |
