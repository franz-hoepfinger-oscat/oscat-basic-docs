## FLOW_METER

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Type** | Function module |
| **Input	VX** | REAL (volume per hour) |
| **E** | BOOL (Enable Input) |
| **RST** | BOOL (Reset input) |
| **I / O	X** | REAL  flow rate fractional part) |
| **Y** | UDINT (flow rate integer part) |
| **Output	F** | REAL (actual flow) |
| | The function module FLOW_METER determines the flow rate per unit of time and count quantities. FLOW_METER determines the flow rate from the input VX and E. The module supports two operating modes are determined by the variable setup PULSE_MODE. If PULSE_MODE = TRUE is the volume flow and the amount determined by is added at each rising edge at E, the value of VX upon itself. If the PULSE_MODE = FALSE the input VX is interpreted as flow per unit time and is  added up as long as E = TRUE. Using the input RST, the internal counter can be always set to zero. X and Y are external to be declared variables and  can be declared retentive / permanent to be permanent in case of power failure. The module provides the instantaneous flow value F as the Real in accordance to the unit connected to VX. If a value at VX is applied eg. in liters / hour so is the measured value at the output F in l / h. The output F is set at the constant intervals UPDATE_TIME. The outputs X and Y make up the over time accumulated measure values where X in REAL represent in the decimal point and Y in UDINT the integer part. A count of 234.111234 is represented by 0.111234 at X and a value of 234 at Y. If for count only a REAL is used then the resolution (for Real to IEEE32), is only 7-8 position . The above described method can provide more than 9 digits before the decimal point (2^32-1) and at least 7 digits after the decimal point. Since in this case X is always smaller than 1, Y can be used for output without decimal places. The two variables X and Y must be declared external and can, as the following example, also be secured against power failure. |
| **SETUP	PULSE_MODE** | BOOL (pulse counter when TRUE) |
| **UPDATE_TIME** | TIME (measuring time for F) |

**Example:**

```iecst
VX := 4 m³/h; PULSE_MODE := FALSE; UPDATE_TIME := T#100ms; The device measures the flow in m³/h and counts the flow as long as the input E is TRUE. The output F shows (4.0m³/h) as long as E is TRUE, otherwise it shows (0.0). The value of F is re-calculated every 100 milliseconds. Example2: VX := 0,024 l/Puls; PULS_MODE := TRUE; UPDATE_TIME := T#1s; In this example, the flow at the output F is displayed in l/h and with each rising edge at E the counter is increased by 0.024 l.
