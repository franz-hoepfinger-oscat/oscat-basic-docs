## SCALE_X4

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Type	Function** | REAL |
| **Input	IN1 .. 4** | BOOL (input values) |
| **K** | REAL (multiplier) |
| **O** | REAL (offset) |
| **Output** | REAL (output value) |
| **Setup	IN_MIN** | REAL (lowest value for IN) |
| **IN_MAX** | REAL (highest value for IN) |
| | SCALE_X4 calculates from the input values IN and the setup values IN_MIN and IN_MAX internal values, then add all the internal values, multiplies the sum by K and add the offset O. An input value IN = FALSE means IN_MIN is included, IN = TRUE means IN_MAX is considered. The sum is multiplied by K and offset O is added. K is not connected then the first multiplier |
| | SCALE_X4 can be used, for example, to calculate total air quantities in ventilation systems, or wherever controlled flaps are used and the resulting total needs to be calculated. By the input offset, SCALE_X2 can easily be cascaded with other SCALE modules. Further explanation and examples, see SCAE_X2. |
