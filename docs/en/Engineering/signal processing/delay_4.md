## Type	Function module

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Input	IN** | REAL (input value) |
| **Output	OUT1** | REAL (by 1 cycle delayed output value) |
| **OUT2** | REAL (by 2 cycles delayed output value) |
| **OUT3** | REAL (by 3 cycles delayed output value) |
| **OUT4** | REAL (by 4 cycles delayed output value) |
| | DELAY_4 delays an input signal by a maximum of 4 cycles. The outputs Out 1..4 passes the last 4 values. Out1 is delayed by one cycle, Qut2 by 2 cycles and Out3  by 3 cycles and Out4 by 4 cycles. |
