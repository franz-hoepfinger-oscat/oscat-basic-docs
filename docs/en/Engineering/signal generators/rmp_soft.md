## RMP_SOFT

| **Type** | Function module |
| **Input	IN** | BOOL (enable input) |
| **VAL** | Byte (maximum output value) |
| **Output** | I/O |
| | RMP_SOFT smooths the ramp of an input signal VAL. The signal  Out  follows the input signal VAL, where  increase time as well as fall time can be limited  by PT_ON and PT_OFF . The rise time  and fall time of the ramps are defined by setup parameter in the module RMP_SOFT. The setup time PT_ON specifies how long the ramp takes of 0..255. A ramp that is limited by the VAL, is accordingly shorter. PT_OFF defines accordingly the falling ramp. If the input IN is set to FALSE, VAL corresponds to a value of 0, so by switching the input IN between 0 and VAL it can be switched. |
| **Setup	PT_ON** | TIME (rise time,  Default  is 100 ms) |
| **PT_OFF** | TIME (fall time;  Default  is 100 ms) |
