## Floating point numbers are stored in the format REAL. A common data format according to IEC754 used a 24 bit wide mantissa and an 8-bit exponent. This results in an accuracy of 7-8 digits. Usually this is for applications in control technology more than sufficient, but in certain cases can lead to a problem. A typical case can which be solved with single-precision only inadequate is a consumption meter. If you want to several Mwh (megawatt hours) of total consumption adding up, taking a smallest power of 1 mW (milliwatt) at a distance of 10ms fairs and so you need a resolution of 3.6 * 10^7 (equivalent 10MWs) and it would be a do add up 1* 10^-5 W's. To do this it requires a resolution of 12 digits.

The solution implemented by OSCAT is REAL Double precision and has a resolution of about 15 digits. The implemented data type [REAL2](Data Types/real2.md) consists of R1 and RX, RX is here the value saved the first 7-8 points as Real and the rest in one real R1. This data type has the advantage that no conversion of [REAL2](Data Types/real2.md) to REAL is needed, rather, the RX  is rather part of single REAL value.
